Supervillains Redux v0.1
by Naruto 607

I've been playing the OfficerLenny's SuperVillains callout for an extremely LONG time, so I tried to make a redux version.
I really liked it, but sadly, it doesn't run on an Episode check, so it doesn't compatible with GTA IV, especially during Niko callout.
	And that reason sometimes made game crash while playing other than TLAD or TBoGT episode/platform.
TLAD and TBoGT deemed to be having such model (IG_NIKO), and in such, it's only compatible with those.

However, for GTA IV, you can still receive callouts from this plugin, which in such: Johnny and Luis are put.


Callouts available:
==================
1.	Niko Bellic: Niko is a veteran from some unnamed war came to LC illegally to work with some people.
		He likes to kill people in cold blood and any victim that's left standing, banished.
		He also did a bank job that no one knows it was him behind the mask with Derrick and Packie ("Three Leaf Clover" mission).
		Now he walked on the streets while carrying a rocket launcher with Jacob and Packie. Jacob himself tried to avoid trouble, but Packie...

	Changes from original: Added two additional peds to arrest or kill (they are not equipped with rocket launcher), made it compatible with Game Episodes

2.	Johnny Klebitz: Johnny (John) is now a President of The Lost Motorcycle Club (TLMC). He often do gang wars with many gang affiliations,
		including the Angels of Death (AOD). Now TLMC has assigned a group to conduct gang war with a new group called "Northern Guardian Division",
		a group that contains members that affiliated with police force and IAA. NGD is required police assistance to end this resistance.
		At some point, the group contains a President with his loyal companions, Clay and Terry. And beware, they are packed wolf.

	Changes from original: When TLAD is used ALL possible gang member models (including IG_CLAY and IG_TERRY) are used, made it compatible with Game Episodes,
		Added IAA models (M_Y_CIADLC_xx) with police relationship to fight with, gang members now can throw only one Molotov Cocktails

3.	Luis F. Lopez: Luis is a bodyguard of Maisonette 9 nightclub. Sometimes in the night he did his job as a henchman for VIPs, but beyond that...
		He kills people for a reason (unlike Niko), can get nuts sometimes like Niko, and participated in Drug Wars with Armando and Henrique.
		Now he went out to the streets driving a van with Armando and Henrique, and he carries a bag of drugs.

	Changes from original: Armando and Henrique are used when in TBoGT, made it compatible with Game Episodes, when Luis left the vehicle it didn't explode,
		Luis' weapons are now adjusted based on the episode/platform (will use Advanced MG when in TBoGT, otherwise Assault Rifle) and no longer equipped with a grenade

To force start one of those, type StartCallout followed by one of these while in SHDN console:
1.	SVNiko: Niko Bellic callout
2.	SVJohnny: Johnny Klebitz callout
3.	SVLuis: Luis F. Lopez callout

All of the callouts here feature:
1.	Accurate DOB (date of birth) for suspects based on game website www.libertycitypolice.com, only when the ID is asked; displayed only for Luis and Johnny
	(note that this is based on the age and the current year of the game, which is 2008, but date/month are randomly picked)
	(no details were given to Armando and Henrique in TBoGT, although they did Drug Wars with many gang members)
	(same goes to Clay and Terry in TLAD; their names are not listed in game website's list)
2.	Special for Niko Bellic (since he's an illegal immigrant), his license is invalid
3.	(TBoGT only) When Luis callout is in motion, Luis will carry drugs as a result of the Drug Wars
4.	Random Compliance Chance (sometimes they can surrender when in a shootout or as a result of tasing)
	(be careful that SWATs/NOOSE teams have no mercy against a suspect, which they can kill them although you really want to arrest him/her)
5.	Bonus Cash (salary) for your service (highest cash earned go to Niko in TLAD and TBoGT since he was too dangerous)
	(it can be an issue if you lost even a suspect, especially in Luis callout)
	(on Niko and Johnny callouts, salary will be given if it's not a prank call)
